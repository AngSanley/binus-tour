<p><strong>Information System Laboratory</strong><br/>The Information Systems Laboratory is a course-supporting unit assigned to conduct laboratory services for BINUS UNIVERSITY students especially those majoring in information systems (including double-degree departments specializing in information systems), computerized accounting, and accounting. In laboratory activities, students are asked to solve problems based on case studies by applying the proper theories. This involves examining and analyzing the problems before designing the solution. The skill of students to solve problems through intermutual discussion will improve. This skill is needed in today&rsquo;s industrial sector, where teamwork is an obligatory skill.</p>
<p>Students are assisted by laboratory assistants. Besides problem-solving skills, students are requested to have competence to model solutions using the tools. Laboratory assistants will demonstrate the use of these tools. Students are extorted to accomplish the final project using these tools.</p>
<p>The Information Systems Laboratory also offers consultation services for final project or theses. Usually the service is provided for students who are in desideratum to procure some other points of view about their proposed design solution.</p>
