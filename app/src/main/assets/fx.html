<p>fX BINUS INTERNATIONAL organized a special event for the Grand Launching of BINUS INTERNATIONAL fX Campus, Wednesday 8/8. CEO BINA NUSANTARA Group Bernard Gunawan, Managing Director BINUS, students, lecturers, parents, corporate partners, media and staff of BINUS INTERNATIONAL were present in this event.</p>
<p>In addition to getting to know each other better, the invitees also learned more about BINUS INTERNATIONAL. There are several majors&nbsp;at BINUS INTERNATIONAL fX Campus, namely Accounting &amp; Finance, Art &amp; Design, Business Management, Communication &amp; Media and Computing.</p>
<p>With an area of 2,172.69 m&sup2;, BINUS INTERNATIONAL fX is an extension of JWC Campus.&nbsp;In the&nbsp;first stage, 14 classrooms and&nbsp;one additional class for studio design were built. In the next stage, there&nbsp;will be&nbsp;seven more classrooms built. </p>
<p>There are also other facilities such as a library, photo copy center, student lounge and coffee shop. In addition, the campus will have a lecturer&rsquo;s room, office and a pantry for staff and lecturers. The capacity of Binus fX is 1000 students.</p>
<p>The project was finished at the end of June 2012 and it will start operating in September 2012, for the odd semester 2012/2013 (17 September 2012). To support mobility, we provide a shuttle bus&nbsp;from BINUS INTERNATIONAL fX &ndash; BINUS INTERNATIONAL JWC Senayan.</p>
<p>With this new building, hopefully BINUS INTERNATIONAL fX Campus will provide better facilities and accessibility to support the students&rsquo; mobility.</p>
